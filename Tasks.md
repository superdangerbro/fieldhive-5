Tasks

Based on the contents of InitialAppPlan.txt and fieldhive-app/README.md, your project is progressing well in terms of setting up the foundational structure. Here's an evaluation of what has been accomplished so far and what needs attention:

Current Progress
Folder Structure

Mobile:
src/components/ for reusable UI components.
src/screens/ for different app screens like Map and Inspections.
src/services/ for Firebase and API services.
src/schemas/, src/contexts/, src/hooks/, and src/assets/ are appropriately organized.
App.js entry points are in place.
Web:
Similar structure with src/components/, src/pages/, etc.
public/ for static assets.
Functions:
Setup for Firebase Functions with service and schema directories.
Shared:
Shared schemas, services, and utilities are organized to promote code reuse.
Firebase Configuration

firebase.js files are created in both mobile and web services directories.
Firebase project is created with Firestore, Authentication, and Storage enabled.
Dynamic Forms and RBAC

DynamicForm.js in mobile components is set up for rendering forms dynamically.
permissions.js in shared schemas defines roles and permissions.
Initial Setup Steps

Firebase initialized in both mobile and web applications.
Expo used to initialize the React Native app.
Dependencies for navigation, maps, and Firebase are installed.
Areas Needing Attention
Authentication Issues

Problem: You mentioned encountering issues with Firebase Authentication, which is critical for user management.
Solution:
Verify Firebase Configurations: Ensure that the Firebase configuration in firebase.js includes all necessary modules and is correctly initialized.
Enable Authentication Providers: In the Firebase Console, double-check that the desired authentication methods (e.g., email/password, social logins) are enabled.
Implement Authentication Logic: Ensure that authentication flows are correctly implemented in both mobile and web apps. This includes sign-up, login, and role assignment.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and debug authentication errors. Use Firebase's error messages to guide troubleshooting.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Current Setup: permissions.js defines roles and permissions.
Next Steps:
Assign Roles to Users: Ensure that each user is assigned the correct role upon registration or by an admin.
Secure Firestore Rules: Implement Firestore security rules that enforce permissions based on user roles.
Admin Interface: Develop the admin interface to manage roles and permissions dynamically, allowing toggling of permissions as needed.
Core Functionality Development

Technician App:
Map Integration: Ensure that react-native-maps is properly configured and devices are correctly geotagged and displayed.
Inspection Forms: Expand DynamicForm.js to handle conditional logic and various field types as defined in your schemas.
Work Order Management: Develop screens and services to create, assign, and manage work orders.
Customer Portal:
Interactive Maps: Implement react-leaflet or Mapbox GL JS for displaying devices and activities.
Reporting: Integrate libraries like react-pdf for generating printable service records.
Testing and Debugging

Unit Tests: Start writing unit tests for critical components using Jest or a similar testing framework.
Real-Device Testing: Continuously test the app on real devices to catch platform-specific issues early.
Deployment Configuration

Expo for Mobile: Ensure that your Expo project is correctly configured for deployment. Test OTA updates to verify they work as expected.
Firebase Hosting for Web: Set up Firebase Hosting and configure next.config.js for optimal performance and security.
Recommendations
Focus on Stabilizing Authentication: Prioritize resolving Firebase Authentication issues before moving forward. This is foundational for user management and security.
Implement Firestore Security Rules: Clearly define and enforce security rules based on roles to protect your data.
Develop Admin Tools: Create intuitive admin tools for managing roles, permissions, equipment types, and forms to ensure scalability and flexibility.
Leverage Shared Code: Utilize the shared directory effectively to minimize code duplication and promote consistency across mobile and web platforms.
Continuous Integration: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployments, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.
Next Steps
Resolve Authentication Issues

Double-check Firebase configurations.
Ensure all authentication providers are enabled.
Implement and test authentication flows thoroughly.
Enhance RBAC Implementation

Assign roles to users correctly.
Implement Firestore security rules based on roles.
Build the admin interface for managing roles and permissions.
Develop Core Features

Continue building out the Technician App's map view, inspection forms, and work order management.
Develop the Customer Portal with interactive maps and reporting capabilities.
Testing and Deployment

Start writing unit and integration tests.
Set up Firebase Hosting for the web app and ensure Expo is configured for mobile deployment.
By following this structured approach, youâ€™ll ensure that your project remains on track, with a solid foundation and the flexibility to scale and adapt as needed. Let me know if you need detailed guidance on any specific area or further assistance with implementation!
